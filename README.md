# Repository for code I use in tutorial.

Here I will make available the notebooks I create for my articles.

For some areas, like SQL and NLP, I have dedicated repositories, so here I will use to store code regarding different subjects.

You are very welcome to use and share all the information here, specifically for educational purposes.
